# Automated Customer Support Ticket System for Financial Services

In the financial industry, customer complaints are invaluable as they often highlight areas for improvement in products and services. Efficiently addressing these complaints not only reduces customer dissatisfaction but also strengthens customer loyalty and retention. Furthermore, resolving issues swiftly provides insights for continuous service enhancement, helping to attract and retain more customers.

However, customer complaints are typically unstructured text data. Traditionally, companies assign teams of support employees to manually review and route each ticket to the appropriate department. As customer bases grow, this process becomes increasingly tedious and resource-intensive.

This project aims to automate the process of handling customer support tickets using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The solution will classify and assign tickets to relevant departments—such as credit cards, banking, or mortgages/loans—based on the content of the complaint. This automation will improve response efficiency and allow the company to scale its customer support system more effectively
